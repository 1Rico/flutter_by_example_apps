# flutter_by_example app repo 

## MeSuite

Flutter By Example is a tutorial site that walks through building a complete Flutter app.

**This repo simply holds the code needed to follow along with the repo.**

You can find more information at [flutterbyexample.com](https://flutterbyexample.com).

The Github for the Flutter By Example website can be found [here](https://github.com/ericwindmill/flutter_by_example_docs)

## Structure
You can follow Flutter By Example from the very beginning, or from any milestone in the app.

*If you want to follow from the beginning, you'll start with a new Flutter app. No cloning here necessary.*

Here, milestones are broken up into branches:

- master - this is the up-to-date app. (Currently: milestone 0)
- 0_boiler_plate_app Includes setup, redux, and firebase auth.


Clone the repo you want, and then head to the corresponding [Flutter By Example](https://flutterbyexample.com) lesson.
